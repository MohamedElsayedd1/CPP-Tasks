In a forest deep and green,
Where sunlight barely sifts between,
Whispers of the ancient trees,
Sing a song of natureâ€™s peace.

Leaves that flutter, soft and light,
Dance with shadows in the night,
Beneath the moon's soft, silver glow,
Silent streams and rivers flow.

In this haven, wild and free,
Nature weaves its mystery.
