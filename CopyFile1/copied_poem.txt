In the hush of dawn, the world awakes,
A symphony of life, the morning makes.
Golden rays of sun pierce through the trees,
Whispers of the wind, a gentle breeze.

Flowers bloom in colors bright,
A tapestry woven in morning light.
Birds on branches sing their tune,
A serenade beneath the moon.

The river flows with a timeless grace,
A mirror to the sky's embrace.
Mountains stand, so strong and high,
Guardians of the earth and sky.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A perfect moment, worries cease.
